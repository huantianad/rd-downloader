# SimpleDownload
Simple Bulk Downloader for the RD Levels Site. Allows you to download all levels or all checked levels from the 
[custom levels site](https://auburnsummer.github.io/rdlevels/).

## Usage
1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/huantianad/SimpleDownload/releases/).
2. Run the file.
3. Follow the prompts. If you don't know how many download threads to use, just use the default.
5. The program will create a new sub-folder ("downloader") and download all the levels there.
   (It might seem like the program is stuck on the last level, it's probably just a big file.)
5. Profit.

Note: if you have the preorder, you can import multiple levels at the same time.
If you do not have the preorder, you can use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to unzip multiple rdzips at the same time.

## Run From Source
If you don't want to use the exe file to run the program, you can also just run the python file.
1. Get yourself [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the python file (`python main.py`)
5. Follow the prompts.
6. Profit.
