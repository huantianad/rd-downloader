# This has been deprecated and replaced by [SimpleDownload](https://github.com/huantianad/SimpleDownload). Please use that if you just want to download all levels.
# RDDownloader
Downloads and unzips RD levels from https://auburnsummer.github.io/rdlevels/.

# Install
Clone this repository and install dependencies with `pipenv install`.
The required packages are requests and clint, if you want to manually install them.

# Usage
Run main.py and input your desired level start and stop (if using default downloading method). 
The script automatically uses the path `C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Rhythm Doctor\Levels` as the download directory. If this path is not valid on your ocmputer, you can change it in config.ini
